# Client-Webpage
Repository for the website of the decided Client of project 2 

# Website Description Given By Claire: 
I am planning to update my professional website to better showcase my recent research activities and teaching experiences. The updated site will serve as a comprehensive platform to highlight my academic and professional contributions, while also providing useful information for different audiences.

The website will feature the following sections (with content and categories to be refined and expanded over time):

- About: A professional overview of myself and the lab.
- Research: Current and past research projects, publications, and areas of focus.
- Teaching: Courses taught, teaching philosophy, and experiential learning approaches.
- Grants: Information on funded research projects, collaborations, and funding acknowledgments.
- Members: Profiles of current lab members, collaborators, and alumni.
- Additional Resources: Other relevant content such as news, media features, outreach efforts, or professional activities.

The primary audiences for the website are current and prospective students, as well as academic colleagues and collaborators. My goal is to create a stronger professional presence online that not only reflects my work but also promotes the activities of my research lab. In doing so, I hope the site will serve as both a resource for those interested in my work and a platform to encourage new opportunities for collaboration and engagement.

Thank you!
